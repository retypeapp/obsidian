By using symbolic links and junctions in your vault, you risk losing or corrupting your data, or crashing Obsidian. Make sure you perform regular back-ups of your vault and settings.","Below are some limitations or issues we are aware of that you may want to keep in mind:","Symlink loops are disallowed, to prevent crashing Obsidian due to an infinite loop.","Symlink targets must be fully disjoint from the vault root or any other symlink targets. Disjoint means one folder doesn't contain another, or vice versa. Obsidian ignores any symlink to a parent folder of the vault, or from one folder in the vault to another folder in the same vault. It is a safeguard to ensure you don't end up with duplicated files in your vault, which could cause links to become ambiguous.","Symlinks may not play well with Obsidian sync, or any other kind of sync. If the target of a symlink is itself a folder that's synced by a different Obsidian vault, you could (potentially) end up with sync conflicts or data loss. Some sync tools, such as Git, don't follow symlinks, but rather sync the path the symlink points to, which may produce undesirable results if you share your vault with other people that way.","Obsidian's file manager can't move files across device boundaries, so if you symlink to a folder on a different drive from your vault, you won't be able to drag files between that folder and other folders using Obsidian's file explorer. (You'll need to use your OS's explorer for such moves, and Obsidian will see the move as a deletion and the creation of a new file. It will also not update any links that depended on the path of that file.)","File symlinks (as opposed to folder symlinks) may work, but aren't officially supported at this time. Changes performed outside of Obsidian aren't watched for, so if you change the file directly, Obsidian won't detect the change, update search indexes, etc.","Symlinking things under the .obsidian/ folder in order to share them between vaults has a high chance of corrupting your settings, unless you really know what you're doing. If you decide to go this way, at least have backups."]}],[{"l":"Back up your Obsidian files","p":["If you haven't backed up your computer yet, it's a good idea to start now! Obsidian’s File recovery plugin is a useful tool, but it only backs up your notes. To be safe, you should also back up the snapshots created by the plugin.","Why back up your data?","By default, Obsidian stores your notes locally on your device, not in the cloud. This means the data is fully yours, giving you control over it. However, local storage can be affected by issues like corruption or data loss. It is never a matter of if, but when. Backing up your data protects against these inevitabilities and ensures you maintain control of your notes."]},{"l":"Syncing is not a backup","p":["Services like Obsidian Sync, iCloud, OneDrive, and Dropbox help you sync your notes across different devices. While they may offer features like note restoration, they are not designed for backups. Syncing keeps your notes updated, but it doesn’t protect against data loss.","Sync: Syncing ensures your files are the same on all devices. When you change a file on one device, it updates on all synced devices. Syncing services do not have a \"primary\" device.","Backup: A backup saves a copy of your data in a different location to help recover it in case of data loss or corruption. Backups are not meant for real-time updates or collaboration.","To properly back up your vault, use a dedicated backup tool that creates a one-way copy of your data. This tool will send your data to a safe backup location without changing the data on your device.","If you use multiple devices with syncing, choose one device to be your backup device. This is usually your main or \"primary\" device, the one you use the most. Note that most syncing services do not recognize any device as \"primary\"; this is just a concept to help you manage backups."]},{"l":"Use community plugins","p":["While the Obsidian Team cannot officially endorse any specific plugin, we recognize two community plugins that have become popular among users for backing up their files:","Obsidian Git: Use this plugin to back up your vault by committing its contents to a GitHub repository. It's an effective way to version control your notes and ensure their safety on a remote server. However, please be aware that your data will be stored on Github using this method.","Local Backup: This plugin allows you to create local copies of your vault in a folder of your choice, with options for archival. You can even use a syncing folder, like a Dropbox folder, to combine local and cloud backups. This method pairs well with the backup options described below."]},{"l":"Use cloud-based services","p":["Keeping your backup in the cloud is an alternative and a complement to physical data storage, instead of an external hard drive or USB stick. An external hard drive or USB stick can be lost or damaged. The biggest advantage of storing files in the cloud is that they are available anytime, anywhere. The downside is, most backup services are owned by a private company.","In terms of security, you should always pay close attention to access and security with cloud backups. Worldbackupday keeps an up-to-date list of online backup services to consider using."]},{"l":"Use external drives","p":["Hard drives and SSD drives External hard drive backups are still valuable in an increasing cloud-based world, and are mainly used for data storage and computer backups. The biggest disadvantage of an external drive is that the drive can break down or get lost. The biggest advantage is that the storage space only needs to be purchased once. Using an external hard drive is often combined with a computer backup.","USB flash drives Flash drives (also called thumb drives, memory sticks, or pen drives) are a simple and effective method for quick backups.","Insert the flash drive into your computer or laptop.","Ensure the device is recognized and mounted in your file system. If necessary, format the flash drive to be compatible with your filesystem.","Copy your vault folder from its current location onto the flash drive.","Safely unmount the flash drive.","Remove the flash drive from your device."]},{"l":"Use computer backups","p":["Your operating system itself offer the ability to help create backups, whether online in the cloud, or in an external drive.","Windows: Backup with OneDrive or an external drive.

This guarantees that no one — not even the Obsidian team — can access your notes.","Standard encryption uses an encryption key managed by Obsidian to protect your data in transit and on our server.","We recommend end-to-end encryption for all users as it is the most private and secure option. However, be aware that if you forget or lose your encryption password, your data remains encrypted and unusable forever. We're not able to recover your password, or any encrypted data for you.","Your choice only affects your remote vault. Obsidian doesn't encrypt your local vault."]},{"l":"What does end-to-end encryption mean?","p":["End-to-end encryption means that the data is encrypted from the moment it leaves your device, and can only be decrypted using your encryption key once it's back on one of your devices.","We can't read your data. Neither can any potential eavesdroppers, such as your internet service provider.","In the rare case of a complete server breach, your data remains encrypted—no one can decrypt your files without knowing your password."]},{"l":"What are the risks of using standard encryption?","p":["Standard encryption is fundamentally less secure than end-to-end encryption, but it can be a convenient option if you do not expect the data you are syncing to be completely private. For example, if your synced vault is published to a public website like this Help site, then end-to-end encryption is not necessary.","Standard encryption is the same method of encryption used by cloud storage companies and software-as-a-service platforms, such as Google Docs, Dropbox, and iCloud (without Advanced Data Protection). Your encryption key is generated by the app and used to protect your data in transit and on the server. Because the encryption key is stored on company servers, it can be used to decrypt your data, e.g. in a case where the company is subject to a search warrant, or in a case where you want to access your data via a web browser.","End-to-end encryption guarantees that Obsidian can never access your data and should always be used to sync data that you wish to remain completely private and secure."]},{"l":"What encryption do you use?","p":["For data security, we implement industry-standard encryption protocols. Specifically, we use AES-256, the strongest encryption standard, widely employed in contexts such as online banking. The encryption process involves the following technical details:","Key derivation function: scrypt with salt","Encryption algorithm: AES-256 using Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)"]},{"l":"Can I verify that my data is end-to-end encrypted?","p":["Yes.

Obsidian has been independently audited. Visit our Security page to view audit reports. Regular audits by third-party security firms ensure that Obsidian code and procedures meet the highest security standards."]},{"l":"What happens if I forget my encryption password?","p":["If you ever lose or forget the encryption password, you won't be able to connect additional vaults to your remote vault. Since the encryption password isn't saved anywhere, it's forever lost.","Your data, however, is usually safely stored locally on each of your devices.","To continue using Obsidian Sync, we suggest doing a full re-setup to be able to add new devices to your Sync system:","Make a full vault backup on your primary device, just in case something goes wrong. This can be as simple as making a copy of the vault folder, or creating a zip file from the vault.","Disconnect the remote vault in each of your devices.
